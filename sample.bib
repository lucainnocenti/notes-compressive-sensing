  abstract = {We establish methods for quantum state tomography based on compressed sensing. These methods are specialized for quantum states that are fairly pure, and they offer a significant performance improvement on large quantum systems. In particular, they are able to reconstruct an unknown density matrix of dimension d and rank r using O(rdlog﻿2d) measurement settings, compared to standard methods that require d2 settings. Our methods have several features that make them amenable to experimental implementation: they require only simple Pauli measurements, use fast convex optimization, are stable against noise, and can be applied to states that are only approximately low rank. The acquired data can be used to certify that the state is indeed close to pure, so no a priori assumptions are needed.}

  abstract = {We present novel techniques for analyzing the problem of low-rank matrix recovery. The methods are both considerably simpler and more general than previous approaches. It is shown that an unknown $n\times n$ matrix of rank $r$ can be efficiently reconstructed from only $O(n r \nu \,\ln ^{2}n)$ randomly sampled expansion coefficients with respect to any given matrix basis. The number $\nu$ quantifies the “degree of incoherence” between the unknown matrix and the basis. Existing work concentrated mostly on the problem of “matrix completion” where one aims to recover a low-rank matrix from randomly selected matrix elements. Our result covers this situation as a special case. The proof consists of a series of relatively elementary steps, which stands in contrast to the highly involved methods previously employed to obtain comparable results. In cases where bounds had been known before, our estimates are slightly tighter. We discuss operator bases which are incoherent to all low-rank matrices simultaneously. For these bases, we show that $O(n r \nu \ln n)$ randomly sampled expansion coefficients suffice to recover any low-rank matrix with high probability. The latter bound is tight up to multiplicative constants.}

  abstract = {We show that, on a Hilbert space of odd dimension, the only pure states to possess a non-negative Wigner function are stabilizer states. The Clifford group is identified as the set of unitary operations which preserve positivity. The result can be seen as a discrete version of Hudson’s theorem. Hudson established that for continuous variable systems, the Wigner function of a pure state has no negative values if and only if the state is Gaussian. Turning to mixed states, it might be surmised that only convex combinations of stabilizer states give rise to non-negative Wigner distributions. We refute this conjecture by means of a counterexample. Further, we give an axiomatic characterization which completely fixes the definition of the Wigner function and compare two approaches to stabilizer states for Hilbert spaces of prime-power dimensions. In the course of the discussion, we derive explicit formulas for the number of stabilizer codes defined on such systems.}

  abstract = {Well-controlled quantum devices with their increasing system size face a new roadblock hindering further development of quantum technologies: The effort of quantum tomography---the characterization of processes and states within a quantum device---scales unfavorably to the point that state-of-the-art systems can no longer be treated. Quantum compressed sensing mitigates this problem by reconstructing the state from an incomplete set of observables. In this work, we present an experimental implementation of compressed tomography of a seven qubit system---the largest-scale realization to date---and we introduce new numerical methods in order to scale the reconstruction to this dimension. Originally, compressed sensing has been advocated for density matrices with few non-zero eigenvalues. Here, we argue that the low-rank estimates provided by compressed sensing can be appropriate even in the general case. The reason is that statistical noise often allows only for the leading eigenvectors to be reliably reconstructed: We find that the remaining eigenvectors behave in a way consistent with a random matrix model that carries no information about the true state. We report a reconstruction of quantum states from a topological color code of seven qubits, prepared in a trapped ion architecture, based on tomographically incomplete data involving 127 Pauli basis measurement settings only, repeated 100 times each.}

  abstract = {The Shannon/Nyquist sampling theorem specifies that to avoid losing information when capturing a signal, one must sample at least two times faster than the signal bandwidth. In many applications, including digital image and video cameras, the Nyquist rate is so high that too many samples result, making compression a necessity prior to storage or transmission. In other applications, including imaging systems (medical scanners and radars) and high-speed analog-to-digital converters, increasing the sampling rate is very expensive.}

  abstract = {Suppose $x$ is an unknown vector in ${\mbi R}^{m}$ (a digital image or signal); we plan to measure $n$ general linear functionals of $x$ and then reconstruct. If $x$ is known to be compressible by transform coding with a known transform, and we reconstruct via the nonlinear procedure defined here, the number of measurements $n$ can be dramatically smaller than the size $m$. Thus, certain natural classes of images with $m$ pixels need only $n = O(m^{1/4} \log ^{5/2}(m))$ nonadaptive nonpixel samples for faithful recovery, as opposed to the usual $m$ pixel samples. More specifically, suppose $x$ has a sparse representation in some orthonormal basis (e.g., wavelet, Fourier) or tight frame (e.g., curvelet, Gabor)—so the coefficients belong to an $\ell _{p}$ ball for $0 < p \le 1$. The $N$ most important coefficients in that expansion allow reconstruction with $\ell _{2}$ error $O(N^{1/2-1/p})$. It is possible to design $n = O(N \log (m))$nonadaptive measurements allowing reconstruction with accuracy comparable to that attainable with direct knowledge of the $N$ most important coefficients. Moreover, a good approximation to those $N$ important coefficients is extracted from the $n$ measurements by solving a linear program—Basis Pursuit in signal processing. The nonadaptive measurements have the character of “random” linear combinations of basis/frame elements. Our results use the notions of optimal recovery, of $n$-widths, and information-based complexity. We estimate the Gel'fand $n$-widths of $\ell _{p}$ balls in high-dimensional Euclidean space in the case $0 < p \le 1$, and give a criterion identifying near-optimal subspaces for Gel'fand $n$-widths. We show that “most” subspaces are near-optimal, and show that convex optimization (Basis Pursuit) is a near-optimal way to extract information derived from these near-optimal subspaces.}
